## About

Available for Windows, Linux and MacOS using and [Avalonia](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia).

Legacy WPF version available in the[ wpf-legacy branch](https://github.com/BobLd/lean-monitor-2/tree/wpf-legacy)

## How to use
### Sessions

- **File**: For backtest, open the main backtest `.json` file. The `order-events.jsom` file will also be loaded. If the button is grayed out, it means that the app can't find the file. You can also replace the `.json` extension by `.qcb` and use Panoptes to open the main file by double clicking on the `.qcb` file.
